## Description
This project involves a personal web development portfolio page for Herman Vulkers (me) from The Netherlands. I am a beginner web developer that created this website as the final project for a full stack web development course at Bit Academy in The Netherlands. The website uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I used JavaScript components for the header and footer of the page, to avoid having duplicate code across the different pages I created. In addition, I used JavaScript to create a dark/light mode toggle. 

## Contributing
I would like to thank the coaches at Bit-Academy for their support and helping me with questions I had during the course. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this README.
